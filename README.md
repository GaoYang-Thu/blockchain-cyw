# blockchain-cyw
blockchain-create-your-own-python

## About
Blockchain-cyw _(cyw = create your own)_ is a direct implementation of [Daniel V. Flymen's work](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) in Python 3, as a starter for understanding the mechanism behind the blockchain.

## Notes
1. Use Postman to carry out GET and POST commands and interact with the blockchain. 
2. You may:
* mine your own block
* add a new transaction to the block
* resolve the conflicts between multiple chains by choosing the longest chain as the authorative one _(this function has some problems on my PC and needs more tuning)_
